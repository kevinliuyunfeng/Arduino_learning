# Arduino_learning
for Xidian University  International Week.

learn the sample examples.

#1 The first class learn the Morse code( Morse_led.ino ).


#2 The second class learn to drive the motors,and added the leds to display the status,but this is only the test,we cannot use this function to drive the true motor ,we should use the driver chips or NPNs ( motor_led.ino ) .


# The third class learn to drive the segment,to use CD4511,which can use to translate the binary to seg-show,we use the 
negative-common IC.
