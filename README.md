# Arduino_learning
for Xidian University  International Week.

learn the sample examples.

#1 The first class learn the Morse code( Morse_led.ino ).


#2 The second class learn to drive the motors,and added the leds to display the status,but this is only the test,we cannot use this function to drive the true motor ,we should use the driver chips or NPNs ( motor_led.ino ) .


#3 The third class learn to drive the segment,to use CD4511,which can use to translate the binary to seg-show,we use the 
negative-common IC.

#4 We update all the code and project ,you can find them in folders.

#4.1 dataseg folder contains the code and simulation picture.

#4.1 Morse_led_lib folder contains the code about morse ehich use the lib written by ourselves.

#4.3 motor_led folder contains the code about drive the motors and use the led to show the status about the motor.

#4.4 Morse_led folder contains the code which has simulate by ourselves,and this translate the lib to function.
